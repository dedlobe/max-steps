I am still working on this problem which wants to find the maximum number of operations to reduce a number to 1 using divisors.
and the final output should be : The maximum number of operations (mod 10^9 + 7).
I solved it but for the bigger numbers it takes a lot of time to get finished. 
I will update the code once i found ad optimized solution for it.


wish me luckðŸ˜˜
